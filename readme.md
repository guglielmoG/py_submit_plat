# Python Challenges Platform



### How it works

After cloning the project, you need to edit `challenges.py` and `solutions.py` in the `source` folder, the former contains the text and related information of each challenge. The second includes the solutions used to check the uploaded script: the rationale here is that many times checking it on just one test is not sufficient to asses the correctness (corner cases).
